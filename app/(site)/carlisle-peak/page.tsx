  },

  {
    "q": "What is the resale value trend for luxury homes in this area?",
    "a": "Luxury properties in guard-gated and premium communities have historically outperformed the broader market in terms of value retention during downturns and appreciation during growth periods. Limited supply in guard-gated communities creates structural price support."

                  <p>Carlisle Peak is a guard-gated · luxury · new construction community within Summerlin in Las Vegas, Nevada (ZIP 89138), spanning 45 acres, with 80+ homes, where home prices range from $1.55M–$2M+. Carlisle Peak is one of Summerlin's newest guard-gated luxury communities, located within the Grand Park village in Summerlin West. Developed by Tri Pointe Homes, Carlisle Peak delivers new-construction luxury in a guard-gated setting at price points that represent a compelling alternative to established ultra-luxury communities like The Ridges. The community began sales in 2023 and features homes designed specifically for the Las Vegas luxury buyer — open floor plans, indoor-outdoor living, and dramatic mountain views of the Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon escarpment.</p>
                  <p>Homes in Carlisle Peak start at approximately $1.55 million and extend beyond $2 million for premium lots with upgraded finishes. Floor plans range from approximately 3,500 to 5,200+ square feet, featuring 4–6 bedrooms, gourmet kitchens, multi-car garages, and the contemporary desert architecture that defines Summerlin's newest construction. Tri Pointe is known for its attention to design and finish quality, and Carlisle Peak reflects that reputation.</p>
                  <p>Grand Park is Summerlin's most actively developing village, positioned in the Summerlin West Association. This means Carlisle Peak buyers benefit from the newest infrastructure, the most modern community amenities, and direct proximity to the trail systems that connect to Red Rock Canyon. The village is also adjacent to the future Grand Park community park, which will be one of Summerlin's largest when completed.</p>
                  <p>The guard-gated entry at Carlisle Peak sets it apart from the majority of Grand Park's neighborhoods, which are gated but not guard-gated. For luxury buyers who want new construction with the security of a staffed guard gate, proximity to Red Rock Canyon, and the Summerlin address, Carlisle Peak is one of a very small number of current options.</p>
